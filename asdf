Let's say goodbye with a smile, dear
Just for a while dear we must part
Don't let this parting upset you
I'll not forget you, sweetheart

We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day

Keep smiling through
Just like you always do
'Til the blue skies chase those dark clouds far away

And I will just say hello
To the folks that you know
Tell them you won't be long

They'll be happy to know
That as I saw you go
You were singing this song

We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day

And I will just say hello
To the folks that you know
Tell them you won't be long

They'll be happy to know
That as I saw you go
You were singing this song

We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
